# Uvee
Uvee is a tool that can export UVs of League of Legends models into PNG files

# How to use
Simply drag and drop the SKN file you want to extract the UVs from on Uvee.exe.

It will create a folder called `Uvee_{modelName}` in the directory of the model.

There will be a file for each submesh in the SKN model.
